In a\nbusiness case, the \"someone\" mentioned in this definition refers to the users or people the product should\nbe developed for. A Mental Model Diagram attempts to capture and visualize a summarized version of\nthe mental models of a certain group of people to provide insight into their thinking patterns. A final Mental Model Diagram resembles a\n\"City Skyline\" [Young 2008].",
